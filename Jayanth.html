<h2>Career Objective</h2><h3>
<p>Self-motivated and hardworking fresher seeking for an opportunity to work in a 
challenging environment to prove my skills and utilize my knowledge & intelligence 
in the growth of the organization.</h3></p>
<h1>QUALIFICATIONS</h1><h3>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor of Technology (ECE) from HOLY MARY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 
AND SCIENCE in 2022.</li> 
<li>INTERMEDIATE from VASHISHTA JUNIOR COLLEGE in 2016.</li> 
<li>SSC from VASAVI PUBLIC SCHOOL in 2014.</li>
</ul></h3>
<h1>Projects</h1>
<ol><h3><li><h3>Project-1: Automatic Street Light Control Based on Vehicle Movement 
Detection</h3>
<dt>Team size:</dt><dd>3</dd><dt>
Prerequisites:</dt><dd>9v Battery, Switch, L.D.R, 
I.C .NE555, L.E.D (Light Emitting Diode) 5 pieces. Variable Resistance of 47 KΩ, 
P.C.B </dd><dt>
Project description:</dt><dd> Street lights are doing more than ever in today’s smart cities. 
With digital networks and embedded sensors, they collect and transmit information 
that help cities monitor and respond to any circumstance, from traffic and air quality 
to crowds and noise. They can detect traffic congestion and track available parking 
spaces. Those very same networks can remotely control LED lights to turn on and 
off, flash, dim and more, offering cities a chance to maximize low-energy lighting 
benefits while also improving pedestrian and bicyclist safety. With street lights 
creating a network canopy, those networks of data can be used by more than just 
lighting departments, empowering even schools and businesses via a lighting 
infrastructure that brightens the future of the digital city. Smart lighting helps cities 
save energy, lower costs, reduce maintenance - all while better serving citizens and 
reducing energy use and CO2 emissions. Automation and networked control can 
further increase your energy savings and reduce maintenance spending. Networked 
street lighting built on a scalable platform can reduce crime up to 10% and make 
roadways safer through improved visibility. Leveraging intelligent control systems 
can rapidly increase lighting efficiencies and traffic management.</dd></li>
<li><h3>Project-2: LIGHT FOLLOWING ROBOT</h3><br>
Team size: 3<br> 
Prerequisites: 2x LDR,2x BC547 Transistors,2x 2 x 30 ohms Resistors, 
 2 x Gear motor wheels,1 x multi-directional wheel, 9-volt Battery.<br> 
Project description: The light sensing robot moves to the direction of light. If the 
light falls on the left side, will move towards the left side and same for right side. 
If the light on both sides is same then it will go straight. The model contains sensors 
(LDR), comparators, drivers, motors, light sources and power source. Normally LDR 
has very high dark resistance, but when it is illuminated with light, resistance drops. 
The voltage across this resistor is fed to the comparator, which compares this 
voltage with a reference voltage and gives output according to that.</li>
